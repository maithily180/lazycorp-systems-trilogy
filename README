Part A — PagedOut Inc. (xv6 demand paging & swapping)
-----------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the xv6 kernel sources and user programs. The goal
for Part A is to implement demand paging (lazy allocation), per-process
swap files, FIFO per-process page replacement, and a `memstat()` syscall
that reports per-process memory state. The autograder will check exact
console logs and the `memstat()` syscall output.

Important requirements (summary)
- Demand paging: do not pre-allocate or pre-load pages at exec or sbrk.
- Page faults: handle faults by allocating, loading from the executable,
  or swapping in from the process's swap file.
- Replacement: on kalloc() failure, evict a page from the same process
  using FIFO (oldest seq first). Track per-process seq numbers.
- Swap file: per-process swap files named like `/pgswpXXXXX` (PID).
- memstat syscall: implement `int memstat(struct proc_mem_stat *info);`
  and the supporting `memstat.h` definitions as specified in the
  assignment.

Exact logging formats
---------------------
All logs must be printed with `cprintf` and match the required formats
exactly (examples):

[pid X] INIT-LAZYMAP text=[0xA,0xB) data=[0xC,0xD) heap_start=0xE stack_top=0xF
[pid X] PAGEFAULT va=0xV access=<read|write|exec> cause=<heap|stack|exec|swap>
[pid X] ALLOC va=0xV
[pid X] LOADEXEC va=0xV
[pid X] SWAPIN va=0xV slot=N
[pid X] RESIDENT va=0xV seq=S
[pid X] MEMFULL
[pid X] VICTIM va=0xV seq=S algo=FIFO
[pid X] EVICT  va=0xV state=<clean|dirty>
[pid X] DISCARD va=0xV
[pid X] SWAPOUT va=0xV slot=N
[pid X] KILL invalid-access va=0xV access=<read|write|exec>
[pid X] SWAPFULL
[pid X] KILL swap-exhausted
[pid X] SWAPCLEANUP freed_slots=K

Build and run (notes)
---------------------

This directory already includes an xv6 kernel tree. Typical commands
used by students:

- Set up a RISC-V toolchain and qemu for riscv64-softmmu (not included
  here). See upstream xv6 instructions.
- From `A/` run `make` or `make qemu` depending on the provided Makefile.

Testing tips
------------
- The autograder tests depend on exact logging and on the `memstat`
  syscall returning correct values. Keep your logging helper functions
  centralized so formats do not accidentally diverge.
- Thoroughly test cases that cause:
  - heap growth via sbrk and lazy allocation
  - stack growth by touching addresses near SP
  - executable pages loaded on demand
  - eviction when physical memory is exhausted
  - swap-in and swap-out behavior including swap-full conditions

Files to examine and modify (guidance)
- `kernel/` — kernel sources; relevant files likely include `vm.c`,
  `proc.c`, `trap.c`, and syscall-related files.
- Add `memstat.h` to define the reporting structs and include it where
  the syscall implementation lives.
